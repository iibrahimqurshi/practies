        <p class="p1">Creating a personal value system is akin to crafting a compass that guides one through life's
            intricate journey.
            It is a reflective and introspective process that demands careful consideration and self-discovery. In this
            essay, I will delve into my personal values, including integrity, respect, responsibility, creativity,

            improvement, professional growth, time management, problem-solving, initiative, and quality. These values
